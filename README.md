# long_read_genome_assembly
- A shell script I wrote while exploring long read genome assembly tools. In this script assembly is done using an example ONT fastq read data and uses shasta, canu, Flye, Miniasm and wtdbg2. The script compares the assembly statistics using QUAST.
- I have made a series of videos on youtube for this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da0V6hm4RSo&list=PLAbpA2ThJEBTDyuffnmYgVZLyc3acEWNQ
